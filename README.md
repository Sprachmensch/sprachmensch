##### Hi, I'm SprachMensch

i've built many games using libGDX and a quite few native :iphone: Android Apps. I've been developing for Android since 2014 and since then i played around with many Topics, like Android TV, Sensors, Firebase, AdMob, different DataBases. Im currently switching over to programming Android Apps in Kotlin. On top i try to improve my HTML5 knowledge ( playing around with different frameworks).
